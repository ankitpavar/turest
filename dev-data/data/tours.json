    "description": "The westernmost state of India, Gujarat is a fascinating combination of architectural marvels, rich heritage, picturesque landscapes, extremely vibrant culture, and delectable cuisine. With all that Gujarat has to offer, it is well-understood why the state is also famed as ‘The Land of Legends’; presenting a perfect amalgam of history, culture, music, and art. The splendour of the scenic beauty that ranges from the Great Rann of Kutch to the Satpura hills is magnetic! The Gujarat coastline, spreading across 1660 kilometre is nothing short of magnificent either. Apart from experiencing these natural beauties, a well-planned Gujarat tour will also introduce you to some of the most amazing historic murals, ancient cave paintings, historic capitals, holy temples, beaches, wildlife sanctuaries, and fascinating handicrafts that the state has to offer. Besides that, Gujarat is also the sole home to pure Asiatic Lions. ",
